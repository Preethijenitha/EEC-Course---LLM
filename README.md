##🤖 Large Language Model (LLM) Experiments & Workflows

🚀 A hands-on project exploring Large Language Models (LLMs), LangChain workflows, tool integration, structured outputs, and scalable AI pipelines using Python.

🌟 Project Overview

This repository contains practical implementations and experiments with Large Language Models (LLMs).

The goal of this project is to understand:

How LLMs work internally

How to build structured AI workflows

How to integrate APIs like Groq

How to design modular and scalable LLM systems

How to handle outputs using structured schemas

This project focuses on real-world AI engineering concepts rather than just basic prompt usage.
